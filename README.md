## Observable Trends from Results 
### (also listed in marked-down cells within the .ipynb)

### Scores by School Spending
 * It's a common conception that the lack of overall student success at schools is directly linked to limited budgets that don't allow for the sufficient resources for students.  The trend in the output above directly contradicts that conception.  Regardless of the school type, the more that was spent on a student per capita the lower the overall performances of the students in terms of average scores and passing rates.

### Scores by School Type
* Students at Charter schools have higher average math and reading scores that students at district schools.  The gap in average scores is higher in the subject of math than the subject of reading.  

* The difference between Charter and District schools becomes widest when you examine the percentage of students passing both math AND reading.  Only about 10% of students at Charter schools are failing in at least one subject whereas almost 50% of District students are failing at least one subject.
